## Description

The goal of this project is to expand on the RISC-V SystemVerilog Model that started as a class group project fro my Introduction to SystemVerilog course. There are multiple tasks/end goals for the project and ideally more will be added as the project continues and as tasks are completed. 

Tasks:
- [ ] Code Refactoring
- [ ] Ensure the model synthesizable
- [ ] Add Emulation Support
- [ ] Emulate the model (If resources are available)
- [ ] Add the Multiplication Extension
- [ ] Add the Floating Point Extension (Check if this is an extension)
- [ ] Create and Add a Cache Model
- [ ] Add Pipelining to the Model
- [ ] Expand the model to 64 or 128 bit
